## Overview

In this project you are going to create a cloud-based file storage service called SurfStore. SurfStore is a networked file storage application that supports four basic commands:

Create a file

Read the contents of a file

Change the contents of a file

Delete a file

Multiple clients can concurrently connect to the SurfStore service to access a common, shared set of files. Clients accessing SurfStore “see” a consistent set of updates to files, but SurfStore does not offer any guarantees about operations across files, meaning that it does not support multi-file transactions (such as atomic move).

## To build the protocol buffer IDL into auto-generated stubs:

$ mvn protobuf:compile protobuf:compile-custom

## To build the code:

$ mvn package

## To run the services:

$ target/surfstore/bin/runBlockServer
$ target/surfstore/bin/runMetadataStore

## To run the client

$ target/surfstore/bin/runClient

## To delete all programs and object files

$ mvn clean
